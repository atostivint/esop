**You have vested options! So now what? You have two paths forward….**

* **Path 1: Business as usual, you don’t actually need to do anything.**

  * Your vested options aren’t going anywhere. You can hold them without making the investment to purchase them as long as you’re part of DoiT.

  * If we have an Exit event (Acquisition, IPO, etc) the company would handle the exercise process for you, subtracting your strike price from any potential payout.

  * If/when Exit time comes, every individual would need to consult an Accountant to pay any required personal taxes from the value of your payout.

* **Path 2: Purchase your vested stock options.**

  * There are some potential tax advantages to purchasing and owning your options for a period of time before we exit, but depending on your country there are also significant upfront tax implications given that the fair market value of one share has increased 8x from when we created our options program.

  * If you are planning on purchasing your stock, please talk to a professional accountant with experience working with stock options and exit processes in your home country so that you can make an informed decision.  Share your option agreement and the current fair market value per share close to the exercise date,  so they have all the up to date and relevant information.

# Stock Option Exercise Process

## Introduction & Guidance

The purpose of this Summary is to elaborate on the entire process of exercising options from the time the employee decides to exercise the share, to the time the shares are issued.

If you are planning on purchasing your stock, talk to a professional accountant with experience working with stock options and exit processes in your home country so that you can make an informed decision.  Share your option agreement and the current fair market value per share close to the exercise date,  so they have all the up to date and relevant information.

## Beginning the Process

Please reach out to [ESOP@Doit-intl.com](mailto:ESOP@Doit-intl.com) to confirm how many options you have vested and your strike price. Here is the [vesting schedule](http://go/options-vesting-schedule) for your reference.

_You do not need to exercise all of your vested options at once. You can choose how many you wish to exercise up to the number of total options you have vested._

## Exercise Notice & Forms

You will be asked to sign the Option Exercise Notice, MLS Joinder Agreement, and the Share Holder Acknowledgement and Understanding. These documents will outline how many shares you are exercising, the price per share, total amount due, and grant date.  You will see “MLS Computer Services” as the company name and this is the company name under which your options are granted, but they are your DoiT options.

## Money Transfer confirmation

Once we receive your signed forms we will have you wire the funds to Do-it’s [bank account](http://go/banks). Please send a confirmation of your wire transfer to finance.

We will convert the numbers into your local currency so you know exactly what to transfer.

We will also need a certified copy of your passport. Finance will confirm receipt of the funds and then we will forward the forms, passport copy, and confirmation of the transfer to our legal team.

## Followup with Lawyers and options certificate issuing

Our legal team will then get approval and appropriate signatures and provide us with the official certificates which we will then send to you. This can take 2-3 weeks to get the official certificates once we have submitted everything to legal.

**Summary of Actionable Items We’ll Need from You:**
