## ESOP Frequently Asked Questions

*A stock option gives you the opportunity, but not the obligation, to purchase a specific number of shares of your company’s 
stock at a specific price for a specific period of time*

### In previous companies I have worked at I signed an options agreement, in one case there was an exit event which was very nice. The DoiT plan is very unusual. I have below a few specific questions but I am curious as to what was the guide in setting up this specific plan? What did you have in mind when writing this non standard options plan?
In general, what we had in mind when we worked this plan is to create a wealth opportunity for our employees, especially for people with senior roles such as yourself. Let me try to provide some guidance in regards to your questions:

In the beginning of the document the shares are 0.001NIS but later it is 168.86$, why is that?
The 0.001NIS is the nominal price of the shares. This is a pretty meaningless number for you but it's required to be specified for accounting and tax reasons. The important number is $168.86$ which is the strike price. The strike price represents the discounted value you will be buying the shares at.

2500 shares from how many?
Right now, the 2500 shares constitute 0.22% ownership stake at the company. This number [0.22] doesn't mean much and will change several times in the future and hence is not mentioned on the plan.

Why is the vesting period starting on April 1st and not at the date of starting work at DoiT?
The plan was adopted by the company last week and can't be 'backdated' to an earlier period. It's just illegal. 

Why is the vesting period 5 years and not the standard 4 years with one year cliff?
Private equity firms typically have an investment horizon (hold period) of five years, which is why this is a five-year vesting schedule; if there is a sale transaction in a shorter time frame, the options vesting accelerates.  There is a range of vesting schedules (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, etc.) that are used for option plans, and Charlesbank (like many other private equity firms) standardizes on annual vesting.

Why is the 20% of ⅓ is on the annual anniversary date and not proportional to the time passed in the year?
Please see the previous answer.

Why do ⅔ of the options depend on the company's performance?
There is a set of options (1/3) that vest based on time, and their value is dependent on the performance of the company.  So that all employees are aligned with our investors and management, there are additional options that have a similarly calculated value (dependent on the value creation above the same strike price, and not above a higher or different strike price) but where the vesting is based on the company surpassing certain EBITDA performance thresholds that are the meaningful performance/return milestones for the investors.  Note that there is no time-based vesting component on these options (2/3), and these could vest a lot faster than the first 1/3 set of options if the company hits those milestones sooner.

If an exit event happens before the performance target, why do I forfeit the performance vested shares?
If an exit event happens before the performance target is met, the options won't vest and therefore won't be eligible to be exercised.

There is an “Error! Reference source not found2.2.” in the document. X 2
This is being fixed. The reference is to Exhibit A (the plan), https://l.doit-intl.com/option-plan

There is no mention of acceleration in case an exit event happens prior to full vesting. Also no acceleration for leaving in “good” cause.
If an exit event happens before the time-based or performance-based options vest,  they won't be eligible to be exercised.

Can you talk about tax, specifically for Israelis in the US?
For legal reasons, we can't provide you with tax advice. You will need to work with your own tax advisor. As a general note, we've spent a lot of time during the work on this plan to make it as tax efficient as possible for DoiT International employees.
