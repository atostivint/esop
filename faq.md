# ESOP Frequently Asked Questions

*If you are not familiar with Stock Option plans in general, a stock option gives you the opportunity, but not the obligation, to purchase a specific number of shares of your company’s stock at a specific price for a specific period of time*

### The ESOP is different from other plans I had in the past and I am curious why?
In general, what we had in mind when we worked this plan is to create a wealth opportunity for our employees.

### In the beginning of the document the shares are 0.001NIS but later it is 168.86$, why is that?
The 0.001NIS is the [nominal price](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-calculate-the-nominal-value-of-a-share) of the shares. This is a pretty meaningless number for our employees but it's required to be specified for accounting and tax reasons. The important number is $168.86$ which is the strike price. The strike price represents the discounted value you will be buying the shares at.

### How was the  strike price of $168.86 calculated?
The strike price is equal to the share price at which Charlesbank made its investment; the strike price is set at this level so that employees are aligned with Charlesbank and share in the upside created together.

### Who is M.L.S Computer Company?
This is the Israel shareholding parent company that owns 100% of all DoiT International's legal entities around the world.

### Can I know the percentage of my ownership?
Right now, every 100 shares constitute approximately 0.01% ownership stake at the company. This number doesn't mean much and may change in the future and hence we advise to focus on absolute number of shares rather than on percentages.

### Why is the vesting period starting on April 1, 2020?
The options plan was adopted by the company on March 28, 2020 and can't be 'backdated' to an earlier period even if you have started to work for the company before that date. 

### Why is the vesting period 5 years and not 4 years with one year cliff?
Private equity firms typically have an investment horizon of five years, which is why this is a five-year vesting schedule; if there is a sale transaction in a shorter time frame, the options vesting accelerates.

### Why is the 20% of ⅓ is on the annual anniversary date and not proportional to the time passed in the year?
There is a range of vesting schedules (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, etc.) that are used for option plans, and our investors (like many other private equity firms) standardizes on annual vesting.

### Why do ⅔ of the options depend on the company's performance?
While 1/3 of your options vest based on time, the 2/3 of options vest based on company performance based on the company surpassing certain [EBITDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization) performance thresholds that are the meaningful performance/return milestones for the investors and the founders.  Note that there is no time-based vesting component on these options, and these could vest a lot faster than the time-vesting options.

### If an exit event happens before the performance target, why do I forfeit the performance vested shares?
If an exit event happens before the performance target is met, the options won't vest and therefore won't be eligible to be exercised.

### There is an “Error! Reference source not found2.2.” in the document. X 2
This is being fixed. The reference is to [Exhibit A](https://l.doit-intl.com/option-plan) 

### There is no mention of acceleration in case an exit event happens prior to full vesting.
If there is a sale transaction in a shorter than 5 years timeframe, the time based options vesting accelerates. If an exit event happens before the performance-based options vest, they won't be eligible to be exercised.

### What happens if I leave the company?
If you decide to leave the company or your role is being terminated (unless for cause), 

### Can you talk about taxes?
For legal reasons, we can't provide you with tax advice. You will need to work with your own tax advisor. As a general note, we've spent a lot of time during the work on this plan to make it as tax efficient as possible for DoiT International employees. 

### Does the plan allow for cashless exercising in the future, would the value of the options exceed the strike price?
Net exercise of stock options is something the board of the company can approve for special circumstances.
